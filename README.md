## Technical Challenges

### TC1 â€” Voting System & Comment Sorting

* Implemented a one-vote-per-user system using a dedicated `Vote` table.
* Backend comment sorting uses OOP inheritance (`CommentSorter` classes) to support extendable and clean logic (e.g., `MostLoved`, `Controversial`, `Trending`).
* Wilson Score used for Net Useful ranking to balance quality and confidence.

### TC2 â€” Optimized Comment Search Engine

* Built a custom search system using an in-memory `wordMap` and persistent `Word` table.
* Search phrase is tokenized, cleaned, and mapped to comment IDs using preprocessed word-to-comment index.
* Final implementation avoids full DB scans and scales efficiently as comment volume grows.

---

## Security

* Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` before storage.
* Sessions managed securely with cookie settings (`SameSite`, `Secure`, and `trust proxy` in production).

---

## APIs Used

* [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) â€” for movie metadata (poster, rating, genre, etc.)
